        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Salt the pork ribs and sear them in a large, heavy-bottomed pot until browned. You may need to do this in batches.</li>
            <li>Add all the pork back into the pot and add water to cover. Add fish sauce, bring to a boil, then turn it down to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Skim off the scum then add onion and tomatoes; simmer for another 45 minutes or until the meat is tender</li>
            <li>Meanwhile,make the tamarind paste by placing the pulp in a bowl and cover with hot water; let sit until cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li>Squish the tamarind with your hand to release the pulp into the water then strain off all the fibers.</li>
            <li>Once the pork is tender, add the vegetables in the order in which they take to cook, starting with harder vegetables and ending with leafy greens first.</li>
            <li>Season the soup with most of the tamarind paste, then taste and adjust with more tamarind and fish sauce as needed.</li>
            <li>Enjoy with rice</li>
        </ol>
